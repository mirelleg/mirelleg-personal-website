    <p class="about-me-desc">Hi, my name is Mirelle, it's great to meet you! I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. As a problem solver, I seek to stand central to technological solutions. As I have been fascinated by technology for years, the advancements in the years previous can only forecast the societal ripples that new developments will cause. As a woman in tech, I strive to be a strong engineer and candidate for the industry.</p>

I also love to play guitar and listen to music. Though I have numerous places on my travel list to visit, I have been to several states and countries. </p>
